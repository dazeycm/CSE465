#What does and doesn't work
All of the included Z+- files work as inteded, with correct ouput. This leads me to believe that everything works in my program. Variable declaration and initialization work as intended, as do for loops.  

#Sample Output
###prog1.zpm
    a = 4
    b = 360
###prog2.zpm
    a = 1
    b = -4
###prog3.zpm
    A = 1032
    B = 31
###prog4.zpm
    A = 1049616
    B = -19943325
###prog5.zpm
    A = 1049616
    B = -19943325
