#Question 3
The Vandelay Language Company is designing a new language based on Java and their language designers have been debating whether their language should allow variable declarations to occur at arbitrary positions in the source code. If they disallow this feature, all variable declarations will need to occur at the top of the function definition. You have been hired as an expert by to write a one page (at most) report detailing the pros and cons of allowing declarations to occur at arbitrary positions. Your report should address the main evaluation criteria, and sub criteria, defined in the textbook (e.g., readability, writeabilty, reliability, cost, etc). When appropriate, you should provide statements/examples to support your claims. Finally, give a recommendation for the proposal on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 represents definitely oppose; 5 represents a neutral; and 10 represents definitely support.

It's important when making design decisions that you take into account many factors. The first is the readability of your source code. I would make the argument that this design decision would not really have an effect on the readability of the code.
